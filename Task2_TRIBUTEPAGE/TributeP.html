                    Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was Born on 31st October 1875 in the village of Nadiad in Gujarat, Vallabhbhai Patel was the fourth in a family of six children. Growing up in Karamsad under the care of his mother Ladba, he often joined his father Jhaverbhai, a farmer, in tilling the land. His father is said to have fought against the British in the army of the Rani of Jhansi in the Uprising of 1857. By the time Vallabhbhai was born, Jhaverbhai had settled into a quiet life of a peasant tilling the ten acres of his ancestral land that belonged to him. Vallabhbhai's mother Ladba was said to have been a very competent woman with a lovely voice. She gathered the children together in the courtyard every evening to sing devotional songs and narrate stories from the epics to them.

                    Although Vallabhbhai joined the village school as a boy, he learnt simple arithmetic and tables from his father whilst accompanying him to the fields. Curious to learn, he asked his teachers in school too many questions. Annoyed, they told him to learn for himself. Taking the cue, much of his learning was self-taught. Feeling the urge to study English, at the age of sixteen after completing his seventh grade in Gujarati, Vallabhbhai moved to Petlad, a small town seven miles from his home, for further studies as his hometown Karamsad did not have an English school. Pursuading six other boys from Karamsad to move with him, he rented a small house in Petlad where they cooked, shared chores and studied.

                    <p style="color:aliceblue">
                        Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, commonly known as Sardar, was an Indian lawyer, influential political leader, barrister and statesman who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to 1950.

                    An iron will and nerves of steel earned Sardar the title of Iron Man. The following anecdote, more than any other, throws light on why Patel was honoured with that unusual title. In the midst of his arguments in a court in Anand in 1909, Patel received a telegram informing him that his wife was no more. Putting away the telegram in his pocket and taking a few moments to collect himself, Patel nevertheless continued with the cross-examination of a key witness in the case. It was only after the proceedings of the day were completed that Patel revealed the bitter contents of the telegram to everybody's shock. Patel's client had been accused of a murder charge. He would not allow his own grief to come in the way of his client's life. His client was acquitted in the case. For this, his steely determination he has been referred also as a Volcano in Ice.
